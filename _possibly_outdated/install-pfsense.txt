NOTES ON INSTALLATION OF PFSENSE
================================

Preparing memstick installation
-------------------------------

pfsense can be installed from local CD drive or from an USB flash disk (if the BIOS supports it). To create a bootable flash drive, just these commands under Mac OS X; for other opering systems check https://doc.pfsense.org/index.php/Writing_Disk_Images:
diskutil list
diskutil umount /dev/diskX
gzcat ~/Downloads/pfSense-memstick-2.2.2-RELEASE-amd64.img.gz | sudo dd of=/dev/diskX bs=16k


Installation
------------

pfSense requires a system with at least 2 physical network interfaces.

Booting the Live/Installer CD can be troublesome at times. Check the notes below if it doesn't automatically proceed. When performing an installation to the hard disk from a bootable CD, pay attention to the messages and input screens. You need to press I at the beginning of the boot process when asked for input to invoke the installation, otherwise it will start the LiveCD after 10 seconds. Alternatively the 'memstick' variant of pfSense can be used to install from a USB flash drive.

Choose quick / default installation of pfSense

Once the installation and the copying process is done, remove the Boot CD before restarting. Otherwise it might boot up again from the CD instead of the newly created installation on the hard disk.

Installation notes:
On the old Baobab servers the 64 Bit version AMD64 had some performance issues with PHP. Switching back to the i386 32 Bit version solved them.

During boot it may or may not be necessary to disable ACPI via boot option (2) (https://doc.pfsense.org/index.php/Booting_Options#pfSense_2.0)

When booting from LiveCD stops in the middle of the boot process (or stops with a mount error as described here https://doc.pfsense.org/index.php/Boot_Troubleshooting), attach an external USB CD drive and coose 'Boot from USB drive' (option 3) at the first pfSense selection screen.


Initial configuration
---------------------

After rebooting the basic network configs need to be configured.

Skip VLAN configuration for now; they can be configured later on.

Configure first network interface (e.g. em0) as WAN (e.g. with 172.16.1.X/24) and em1 as LAN (e.g. with 192.168.1.1/24) and enable DHCP services per devices as needed.

Connect with a cable to the LAN port (e.g. em1), wait until your computer receives an IP address from the pfSense and open the web browser pointing to above http://192.168.1.1. Use admin/pfsense as username and password.

Finish the installation wizard by following the instructions on the screen.


Configuration
-------------

Enable remote access on WAN interface for SSH and web management through System - Admin Access - Advanced - Activate HTTPS for WebConfigurator and Enable SSH (Secure Shell)

Adjust timezone if needed

Change and add network interfaces as needed, e.g. add vlan interfaces to em1 starting from 192.168.11.x upwards, don't forget to disable the parent interface for these VLANs (e.g. em1)

Configure/activate DHCP server for every inside network/VLAN interface as required

Set DHCP server lease time to 43200 (note that this must be greater than any Captive portal and RADIUS session timeouts)

Deactive 'block bogon networks' and 'block private networks' if the WAN IP is not a public IP

Disable IPv6 (System -> Advanced -> Uncheck Allow IPv6)

Add pfsense.localdomain to DNS Forwarder/Resolver as host overwrites with the IP of the WAN interface. Services - DNS forwarder - add new host override with host = pfsense, domain = localdomain, IP = 172.16.1.2 and description = to make pfsense.localdomain locally available (e.g. required for radcheck)

Add firewall rule to allow TCP, UDP, and ICMP pings (easiest done through 'floating rules')

Add firewall rules on wan interface to allow traffic on port 3000 (for ntop)


Captive Portal
--------------

Create and enable new Captive portal zone labeled apzunet on the internal LAN interfaces

Activate 'Disable concurrent logins'

Configure RADIUS server with RADIUS authentication and RADIUS protocol PAP

Set IP of primary RADIUS server to 127.0.0.1

Use testing123 as the shared secret

enable 'send RADIUS accounting packets' with 'interim updates'

enable 'RADIUS MAC authentication'

set 'MAC authentication secret' to radius

enable 'Use RADIUS Session-Timeout attributes'

Save settings

Upload files marsPortal/setup-captiveportal/captive-portal_page.php as captive portal 'Portal page contents'

Use File manager of Captive portal to upload all files from marsPortal/setup-captiveportal/filemanager/*

optional: add all local IP addresses and external hostnames as allowed systems where access should be possible without passing through the Captive Portal (to bypass captive portal registration and traffic accounting for local servers, e.g. with 172.16.1.0/24)


Installation of additional software/packages (requires Internet access)
--------------------------------------------

Install pfSense packages 'ntop', 'squid3', 'lightsquid', 'mailreport' from 'system - packages - available packages'

Enable transparent Squid for HTTP and activate logging

Enable Lightsquid (Proxy report) reporting

Login with SSH as root and run these statements in the shell (to get to the shell press 8) with a working Internet connection:
pkg
pkg update
echo y | pkg install bash
echo y | pkg install wget
echo y | pkg install curl
echo y | pkg install ssmtp
echo y | pkg install git
echo y | pkg install mysql56-server
echo y | pkg install freeradius
rehash
ln -s /usr/local/bin/bash /bin/bash

---------------------------------

Go to System - Advanced - Notifications and enter

E-Mail server: smtp.gmail.com

Depending on the gmail account configuration you might need to enable 'less secure apps' for this gmail account 


Additional notes
----------------

On some installations the local console is not shown - it stops with the 'bootup complete' message, unclear how to solve this: https://forum.pfsense.org/index.php?topic=34814.0. In my case the file /etc/ttys was corrupt and was replaced with a working file from another system. This file is available under docs/install - ttys.example.

When temporarily deactivating a network interface to shutdown a certain area of the network, pfSense needs to be rebooted
