RADIUS configuration
====================

Link overview: http://192.168.0.2/mars/admin/index.html


RADIUS groups
-------------

Management - Profile

Most of the behaviour is defined through RADIUS groups. These groups can list various restrictions and the name of the group can be freely chosen. Optionally for each group there can be additional groups with the name postfix -open-for-today and -non-work-hours.

-open-for-today can be used if single systems have used up their available data bundle(s) and need to be temporarily unblocked for the rest of the day. All devices placed in this group will be automatically be moved back to their main groups.

The group -non-work-hour contains group settings for devices outside of working hours (often Monday to Friday between 8:00 and 17:00.

Finally a default group No-Internet-access is available. All outside network access (sometimes depending on the network setup) is blocked. Note that this still gives local (on the level of the subnet) access for these devices.


Changing restrictions of groups
-------------------------------

Management - Profiles - Edit profile

Each RADIUS group can have these following attributes
- WISPr-Bandwidth-Max-Down: Max download bandwidth (bits per second)
- WISPr-Bandwidth-Max-Up: Max upload bandwidth (bits per second)

- Session Timeout: Time after which a Captive Portal sessions expires (in seconds, needs to be smaller than DHCP lease time; 43200 for 12 hours is a reasonable value)

- mars-Max-Concurrent-Devices: Number of concurrent connected devices (session) per group

- mars-Input-Megabytes-Daily-Work-Hours: Upload data bundle during work hours (in MB)
- mars-Output-Megabytes-Daily-Work-Hours: Download data bundle during work hours (in MB)

- mars-Input-Megabytes-Daily-Total: Daily upload data bundle (in MB)
- mars-Output-Megabytes-Daily-Total: Daily download data bundle (in MB)

- Auth-Type with value Reject: Use to completely block all devices of this group. Can be temporarily added to existing groups to prevent them from accessing outside network in case the network should only be available to selected devices.


Changing work and lunch hour times
----------------------------------

Work and lunch hours times are defined through the file /home/marsPortal/config.txt. Log in via SSH and edit the file.

There is one line for each time boundary (WORK_START, LUNCH_START, LUNCH_END, WORK_END). Change the values as needed.


Device management
=================

Registering new device
----------------------

marsPortal - Devices - New device - Add attributes as required and  choose a default group.

If enabled in the captive-portal_page.php, devices can also be added directly from the page of the devices indicating that it is an unknown device.


Changing group of a device
--------------------------

marsPortal - Devices - Edit one device - Group - Select new group.


Opening blocked device for the rest of today
--------------------------------------------

marsPortal - Devices - Edit one device - Group - Select matching -open-for-today group.


Misc
====

Blocking Adult content
----------------------

Generic blocking of all (most) Adult content sites for all is best done through EasyTomato. Check 'Block Adult Content' from Universal Blocking Rule at the Easy Tomato Groups page. This feature uses (parts of) the OpenDNS Family shield (a commercial DNS server), thus an error message coming from OpenDNS is displayed when accessing such pages.

Notes: Ensure, that all client devices are using the EasyTomato as a DNS server. Most often done by having the DHCP server giving out the IP address of EasyTomato. If a client does not use the EasyTomato DNS server, then access will not be blocked. To tighten up the system, all DNS traffic to other DNS servers could be blocked, e.g. via a pfSense Firewall rule.


Block access to any domain, like facebook
-----------------------------------------

If access to specific sites should be blocked during specific times of the day, create new rule(s) for the unclassified devices group within EasyTomato. Besides selecting days and times multiple domain names (or parts of it) can be added, e.g. facebook, twitter, ... (each in one line)

The same notes as above for the blocking of adult content regarding DNS servers apply. Due to the implementation details of this feature, access to these sites will often (especially for HTTPS) time out without a proper notice to the client device that access to these pages are blocked.


Maintenance
===========

Changing passwords
------------------

pfSense root & Admin UI
- Admin Web UI - System - User Manager - admin
- edit /home/marsPortal/config.txt and change PASSWD

marsPortal UI
- Edit file /home/marsPortal/config.txt and adjust values for HTTP_AUTH_USER and HTTP_AUTH_PASSWD

MySQL:
- Direct remote login to the MySQL server process should be deactivated, and therefore already reducing the risk of misusing the default username and password. If you still want to change, follow these steps:
1. Change MySQL passwords for users root and radius
2. Edit and adjust values for MYSQL_USER and MYSQL_PASSWD in /home/marsPortal/config.txt
3. todo: change values for freeRADIUS MySQL connection


Backup & Restore
----------------

Backup up the whole database (including registered devices and accounting history):
mysqldump -u root -pradius radius > /tmp/mysql-dump.sql
Copy /tmp/mysql-dump.sql to another system, e.g. with scp /tmp/mysql-dump.sql USER@SERVER:

Restore/reload device registration and accounting dump to a new system (requires that this system is 
configured similar to the old setup while following instructions from install.txt):
Copy database backup from another system, e.g. with scp USER@SERVER:mysql-dump.sql /tmp
mysql -u radius -pradpass radius < /tmp/mysql-dump.sql


Changing IP addresses
---------------------

There are a couple of places where IP addresses of the pfSense and daloRADIUS configuration are relevant. When changing IP addresses and/or subnets they should all be changed together (typically in the following order):
- IP address of NAS configuration within daloRADIUS: Via daloRADIUS web admin - Management - NAS - change NAS IP/Host
- Network config of daloRADIUS guest: Go to Virtual Box console of host system and select: Advanced - Networking - Static IP address
- Network config of daloRADIUS host system: Depending on the host operating system
- If required, all Access Points within the LAN
- RADIUS server IP within pfSense Captive Portal setting.
- IP address of LAN interface from pfSense: pfSense Admin GUI - Interfaces - LAN - IP 
- Check and verify the DHCP server settings to see if they still match. Note that most likely previous static DHCP mappings will be automatically removed.
- Make sure that the files /home/marsPortal/config.txt om both the daloRADIUS and pfSense system contain the recent values.
- Reboots of the systems are usually not required, but won't hurt either.


Reset accounting data
---------------------

If accounting data needs to be removed (e.g. for a fresh start), these statements from a daloRADIUS shell can be invoked:

/home/marsPortal/misc/captiveportal-disconnect-all-users.sh
mysql -u radius -pradius radius <<EOF
truncate daily_accounting;
truncate daily_accounting_v2;
truncate radacct;
truncate accounting_snapshot;
EOF
/home/marsPortal/daloradius-accounting/accounting-snapshot-beg-of-day.sh
/home/marsPortal/daloradius-accounting/accounting-snapshot-v2.sh day_offset


Troubleshooting
===============

Validating RADIUS connectivity
------------------------------

If there is a problem in the configuration between pfSense and daloRADIUS no outside network access is granted. To check if with the RADIUS config itself everything is fine, run this command from a pfSense shell. Make sure at least one device is registered within daloRADIUS with its MAC address and change the MAC and IP addresses of the following command as needed:

radtest 00:25:00:48:60:10 radius 127.0.0.1 0 testing123
radtest 08:00:27:d7:d7:e9 radius 192.168.0.2 0 radius

Problems trying to connect to DHCP
----------------------------------

When (Windows) devices have problems picking up changed DHCP servers, it is worthwhile to try a 'ipconfig /release' followed by a 'ipconfig /renew' from the command prompt.
